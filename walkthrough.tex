\section{Walkthrough Example}

DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM AGAIN WITH MORE DETAIL

\subsection{Data Retrieval}
Just move what we already have in the Data retrieval section here.

\subsection{Simple Visualization}
Here we show simple non-interactive visualization using vidette. We get a chance to say how intuitive everything is and how awesome it is that we can inline functions in these units.

\subsection{Interactive Visualization}
Here we show the modifications needed to go from simple to interactive visualizations. This way we point out that going from naive to advanced visualizations take minor modifications in the units and everything is taken care of under the hood.
