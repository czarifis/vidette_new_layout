Despite the plethora of recently proposed tools and frameworks, common data analysis tasks such as data retrieval, curation and visualization remain laborious and non-trivial. The limited flexibility of existing frameworks, pushes code-literate data analysts to interactive notebooks such as Jupyter. 

In this work, we argue that interactive notebooks are suboptimal for commonly performed tasks, with regards to their ease of use and interactivity. We propose \projname , a framework designed to facilitate data analysis through the utilization of a template language. We implement a sample data analysis work flow and present the benefits of using {\projname} instead of commonly used imperative language in iPython and Jupyter notebooks.
