\remark{Costa, the algorithms you have for this section are completely unreadable. I don't think it helps anyone who reads it and it will take forever if we actually want to explain it in text. I assume (hope) these are algorithms that run in the background (under the hood vidette functions) and not something the analyst needs to write. If that's the case, let's describe the operation of those functions logically in text. If the analyst actually needs to write that code, I don't think we have a submit-able paper here.}
